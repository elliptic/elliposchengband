Q:20:T:Something curious has taken root beneath our Inn.  Celebor,
Q:20:T:the innkeeper, has reported strange vapors and auras in the
Q:20:T:basement that drive out all living things.  A caged canary was
Q:20:T:placed there to test the air quality; it died within minutes,
Q:20:T:though the strange scents had vanished when the investigators
Q:20:T:returned.  Then, suddenly, it was as if the air itself attacked!
